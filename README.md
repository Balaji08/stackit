## Thanks
This project is possible because of several other pre-existing projects and their contributors:

+ [Py-StackExchange](https://github.com/lucjon/Py-StackExchange): a Python wrapper for the StackExchange API
+ [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests): "HTTP for Humans"
+ [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/): pretty data parsing for HTML/XML files, so you can read stuff
+ [Karan Goel](https://github.com/karan)'s work with [joe](https://github.com/karan/joe) was a tremendous help in designing a command line tool in Python, and his [Medium article](https://medium.com/@karan/these-6-simple-changes-made-my-recent-side-project-go-viral-53fd6571c11c) on putting together a good readme is an inspiration to us all. Thank you based joe.
+ Peter Downs has a great [article](http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html) on how to submit a package to PyPI.
